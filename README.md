# PythonIntro
Weekly projects for Introduction to Programming.

Note that many solutions use code that hasn't been covered yet.
If you see something unfamiliar, I encourage you to look up its 
use, or ask me, rather than just copying what I wrote, so you 
can learn it and implement it yourself later.

If you have questions do feel free to contact me.
